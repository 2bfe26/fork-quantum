# Quantum
CSS in JS based reusable components, are the core of Quantum
design-system: a library for developing consistent UI/UX at Catho.

## Starting from scratch
Quantum can be easily included in applications or one-off projects. We
recommend pulling the latest version of Style Guide's CSS from our
CDN. You may also clone this repository and pull in the component SCSS
files if you wish to only include a portion of Style Guide in your
project.

### React based
We have chosen React as our preferred front-end framework. To that end, we
maintain the sibling project UI Components, which implements Style Guide
as React Components. If you are building a feature in React, prefer this
library because the components encapsulate logic, markup, and (in the
future) styles. Repository Storybook On NPM.
